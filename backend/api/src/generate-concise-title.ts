      const system = `Make this prediction market question more concise while preserving its core meaning. Keep the same level of precision and specificity, but make it more concise.
Guidelines:
- Use declarative statements ending with question marks
- Use English words rather than symbols/notations, e.g. 'More than' instead of '>'
- Keep essential dates, numbers, and conditions
- Keep important distinctions between market types (date, numeric, multiple choice, and binary), i.e if the market is forecasting 'when' something might happen, keep that distinction
- Remove unnecessary words, phrases, notations, e.g. "will", etc.
- Keep it concise
- Do not return anything other than the concise title, unless the question is already concise and declarative, in which case return a blank string
- Do not suggest a longer title than the original. If you can't make it more concise, just return a blank string
- Keep personal markets personal, e.g. "Will I go to the gym this week?" should NOT be changed to impersonal forms like "Personal gym attendance this week"

Example transformation:
"Will a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine be declared within 90 days of Trump entering the office of the presidency?" => "Russia-Ukraine ceasefire in Trump's first 90 days?"
"Will the first AI model that saturates Humanity's Last Exam be employable as a software engineer?" => "1st AI model to saturate Humanity's Last Exam employable as a SWE?"
"In early 2028, will an AI be able to generate a full high-quality movie to a prompt?" => "Full, high-quality AI movie generator by early 2028?"
"Will there be a US recession by EOY2025?" => "US recession by EOY2025?"
"Will I go to the gym this week?" => "I go to the gym this week?"
"Will I get a girlfriend this year?" => "I get a girlfriend this year?"
"Will I think getting an art MFA was worth it?" => "I'll think getting an art MFA was worth it?"
'When will Manifold implement a charity program?' => "Manifold charity program by date?"
"US doctors negatively affected financially by AI by EOY2025?" => "" (no change - already concise and declarative)
"Substack publications at 5M+ paid subscribers by 2025?" => "" (no change - already concise and declarative)
"'A Minecraft Movie' (2025) Rotten Tomatoes critics score?" => "" (no change - already concise and declarative)
